## Embedded C programming
C is a programming language designed by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs. C is very widely used, straightforward, and can be compiled to a number of platforms and operating systems. C is an imperative language, with a small number of keywords and a large number of mathematical operators. I included programming libraries,guides etc..

## Motivation
These program are meant for helping others who want to learn c programming from basics and also help them understand certain coding techniques and ideas.

## Build status
Build status of continus integration i.e. travis, appveyor etc. Ex. - 

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/akashnimare/foco.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/akashnimare/foco)
[![Windows Build Status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/akashnimare/foco?branch=master&svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/akashnimare/foco/branch/master)

## Code style
If you're using any code style like xo, standard etc. That will help others while contributing to your project. Ex. -

## Screenshots
Include logo/demo screenshot etc.

## Tech/framework used
Ex. -

<b>Built with</b>
- [Electron](https://electron.atom.io)

## Features
What makes your project stand out?

## Code Example
Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## Installation

Install Eclipse Oxygen IDE on Ubuntu 16.04 through terminal in ubuntu
Step 1: Install Java JDK8
Run the commands below
  sudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/java
After running the commands above, you should see a prompt to accept the PPA key onto Ubuntu… accept and continue
Now that the PPA repository has been added to Ubuntu, run the commands below to download Oracle Java 9 installer…. the installer should install the latest Java JDK 9 on your Ubuntu machines.
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install oracle-java8-installer
When you run the commands above you’ll be prompted to access the license terms of the software… accept and continue..

  sudo apt install oracle-java8-set-default
The command above will automatically set Java 9 as the default… and that should complete your installation, you can check you java version by running following command.

javac -version
