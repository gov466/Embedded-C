## Embedded C programming
C is a programming language designed by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs. C is very widely used, straightforward, and can be compiled to a number of platforms and operating systems. C is an imperative language, with a small number of keywords and a large number of mathematical operators. I included programming libraries,guides etc..

## Motivation
These program are meant for helping others who want to learn c programming from basics and also help them understand certain coding techniques and ideas.

## Build status
Build status of continus integration i.e. travis, appveyor etc. Ex. - 

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/akashnimare/foco.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/akashnimare/foco)
[![Windows Build Status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/akashnimare/foco?branch=master&svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/akashnimare/foco/branch/master)

## Code style
If you're using any code style like xo, standard etc. That will help others while contributing to your project. Ex. -

## Screenshots
Include logo/demo screenshot etc.

## Tech/framework used
Ex. -

<b>Built with</b>
- [Electron](https://electron.atom.io)

## Features
What makes your project stand out?

## Code Example
Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## Installation
Provide step by step series of examples and explanations about how to get a development env running.

## API Reference

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

## Tests
Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.

## How to use?
If people like your project they’ll want to learn how they can use it. To do so include step by step guide to use your project.

## Contribute

Let people know how they can contribute into your project. A [contributing guideline](https://github.com/zulip/zulip-electron/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) will be a big plus.
